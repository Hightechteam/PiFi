## What is PiFi

PiFi is a project intended to have a zer-configuration privacy dongle for WiFi connections. Imagine that you can use a WiFi dongle with your computer that authomatically uses VPN, filters ads and malware, routes traffic through Tor... This is PiFi

## Status of PiFi

I just Started this project so no much use of it now. But I am already using it to connect o internet and filter ads, so something is something. This is a rough roadmap:

- [x] installing base system
- [x] emulating a network connection through USB
- [x] manual WiFi configuration
- [ ] ugly web-based WiFi connection tool
- [ ] web integration
- [x] bridging traffick through WiFi connection
- [x] ad blocking with [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/)
- [ ] VPN connection
- [ ] Tor Proxy
- [ ] Installer
